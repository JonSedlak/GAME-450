# Prompt Engineering Process

1. Added user input and have it loop
2. Loop is broken and cannot enter in user input after 1st try. It keeps using the orginal message over and over unless I force quit.
3. Fixed the loop isue. Attempts.txt is now generating
4. Tried adding an intital statement. did not really work
5. Changed the temperature and system role content to more accurate
6. Went back to original conditions. Added an if statement to check for original message. Works now
7. Decided to get rid of If Else statement for initial message. Changed the system content to: You are a DND master
8. **I now have a better understanding how ollama works and the flow of series of messages**
